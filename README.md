# spell-checker
Spell checker to check for spelling mistakas in a text, provided a dictionary. Not intended for public use. Made for Harvard's CS50 course, as part of an assignment to learn data structures. I implemented a trie (a complex data structure) to solve the problem, using nothing but plain C.
